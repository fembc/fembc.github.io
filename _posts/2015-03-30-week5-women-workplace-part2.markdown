####Discussion Topics
* What is "holding women back" from achieving the same levels of success as men? 
* Do we as women view "success" differently from men? How does having a family affect a woman's career vs a man's?
* As women, we typically outperform men in terms of emotional intelligence and communication skills. How can we leverage that in the corporate sphere? 
* How can we cooperatively and productively shift the archaic views of women in the workplace?
* Women are greatly underrepresented in scientific and mathematical fields. Why is that? What can we do to change that?
